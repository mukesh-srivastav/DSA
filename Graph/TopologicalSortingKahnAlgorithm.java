/**
 * In this article we will see another way to find the linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The approach is based on the below fact :

A DAG G has at least one vertex with in-degree 0 and one vertex with out-degree 0.
Proof: Thereâ€™s a simple proof to the above fact is that a DAG does not contain a cycle which means that all paths will be of finite length. Now let S be the longest path from u(source) to v(destination). Since S is the longest path there can be no incoming edge to u and no outgoing edge from v, if this situation had occurred then S would not have been the longest path
=> indegree(u) = 0 and outdegree(v) = 0

Algorithm:
Steps involved in finding the topological ordering of a DAG:

Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the DAG and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.

Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)

Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.

Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.
Step 5: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.

Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph then the topological sort is not possible for the given graph.
